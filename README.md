# Robust-to-label-noise
This is a demo project for demonstrating algorithms that are robust to label noise.

## Getting Started
This project aims to conduct research based on the fundamental architectures of LeNet and AlexNet. They designed a backward noise correction and a transfer matrix estimation algorithm based on the anchor point method, aiming to enhance the classifier's robustness to label noise. Experiments were conducted on three datasets with label noise (FashionMNIST 0.5, 0.6, CIFAR). The results indicate that deep neural networks, when deployed with the backward noise correction algorithm, exhibit stable performance in noisy environments, leading to improved model performance and generalization ability.
